# PyFileSys

Implementing a file system in python for Operating Systems Class
Little coding experience is required to take the class, so python is used to minimize sytax issues and new language fears

# Current stuff in the project:
  * Minimal Command prompt window (run in python, has suff like ``` ls, cd, mkdir, rm, echo ```
  * Seperate Filesystem object definition that creates an initial filesystem and blockmap
  
# Eventually it will have:
  * the ability to be called from the command prompt 
    * all commands in command prompt will instead work on the filesystem the other module creates


# Probably more as well
